Purchase, Purchase Return, Sales, Sales Return will be bound to Books table, but deletion should be supported, since 
deleting a book is not an infrequent use case. For this purpose, code will be adjusted and specific
columns will be added in the domain classes. Book Num, Book Name and Book Id will be preserved for reference.

Purchase Det will be bound to Order Det Id, since deleting School can create issues. During a school deletion, code
should be added to update relevant Order Det Ids in Purchase Det. For Sales Det, this is not an issue, as the school
itself is getting removed.

Financial Year will be used internally to enforce uniqueness for Purchase, Sales, Purchase Return, Sales Return,
Purchase Payment, Sales Payment. This is because the receipt/bill/credit note numbers may repeat after 9999. There is no
need of Serial No. in these tables anymore.

Prefix in Order is removed. Customer name is not required either. Customer is to be linked to Customer table.

Sales , Sales Return  and School Payment will have Cust Id to reach to Customer if transaction is deleted.
