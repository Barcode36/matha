SOrderSeq and SalesSeq creation scripts to be updated with current max value

Book - Serial Number generation/update - TBD. BK<NUM> is the format. 

Open Issues:
District not populating in Edit School

Shouldn't there be a functionality to prevent billed order items from getting modified?
If an update happens to an OrderItem, shouldn't the corresponding invoices/returns/statement reflect the change?
